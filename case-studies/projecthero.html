                <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-light">It’s a struggle for construction workers in India to get a job of their choice, to get paid what they deserve, to improve their work, life and financial condition and to carry their construction jobs with a sense of pride.</p>

                <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-light">On the other side of the story, contractors and builders struggle to find good/productive workers for their projects, manage them and their payrolls when they are deployed, and incentivize them monetarily to do a great job.</p>

                <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-light">Projecthero (PH) is India’s first and largest construction workers platform and sets out to connect and solve above two sides of the problems.</p>

                        <li>I joined ProjectHero as <span style="color: #efc41a;">VP Product</span>  to lead the product when they had just raised seed round of funding and were looking to develop Android app for workers and Web app for contractors.</li>
                        <li>I was working with two junior designers to assist me. While I was accountable to define the ux concepts, set the design foundation and direction, I also designed a lot of interfaces as we wanted to ship the first few iterations of the app as quickly as possible (we actually launched v1 to playstore in 3 weeks!)</li>
                        <li>It was a short stint of 5 months from <b>March 2022 to July 2022</b></li>

                    <h3>Learning deeply about construction workers pain-points, behaviour and unexpressed needs</h3>

                    <p>I conducted user interviews both on-site where heroes were staying and working as well as via video calls.</p>
                    
                    <p>A weekly user testing session with a group of workers, both employed and unemployed, helped me gain early insights into design decisions.</p>
                    
                    <p>I asked them questions to learn more about them and their problems:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How do you find a job?</li>

                        <li>How you travel to job city and site?</li>
                        <li>How do you maintain and remember daily number of hours and overtime?</li>
                        <li>How your salary is paid and in what cadence?</li>

                        <li>Most constructions workers e.g. Mason, Plumbers, Shuttering etc. come from poor families and depend on their daily wage. </li>
                        <li>They are acquainted with smart phones via using common apps e.g. Whatsapp, YouTube, Facebook, Sharechat etc. but anything complex make them apprehensive. </li>
                        <li>They are anxious about money all the time remembering their daily hours and work either just mentally or noting them down on paper. Even if a Rs. 1 less is paid to them, it’s a matter of concern to them. </li>
                        <li>They understand Hindi or Hinglish language as most of them come from Eastern belt of UP.</li>
                        <li>They aspired for better accommodation and work conditions</li>
                        <li>They were not able to leverage their years of previous experience to get paid more</li>
