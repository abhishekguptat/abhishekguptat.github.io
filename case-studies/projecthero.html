                        <li>They are acquainted with smart phones via using common apps e.g. Whatsapp, YouTube, Facebook, Sharechat etc. but anything complex make them apprehensive. </li>
                        <li>They are anxious about money all the time remembering their daily hours and work either just mentally or noting them down on paper. Even if a Rs. 1 less is paid to them, it’s a matter of concern to them. </li>
                        <li>They understand Hindi or Hinglish language as most of them come from Eastern belt of UP.</li>
                        <li>They aspired for better accommodation and work conditions</li>
                        <li>They were not able to leverage their years of previous experience to get paid more</li>
